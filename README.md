# CISC-4900
Code relating to a senior capstone project
In this project, I worked with a professor to wire and power a homemade CNC machine, and learned the language Gcode for the sake of testing the machine
The end goal was to try and make the machine entirely functional, and capable of milling into soft woods. 
This project not only involved the self-teaching of LinuxCnC and the machine language Gcode, but involved me wiring plugs for motors, connecting those motors to microstepping drivers and those drivers to a CNC interface board, and then connecting all of that to a power source - all the while ensuring the wiring had no shorts, passed currents adeqately, and the stepping was set up properly.
